# SOLIDITY

## Simple Token Contract Project
This project aims to create a simple program that will do the following with said features: (for educational purposes only)

### Key Features:

- **Token Name:** This contract represents an token with the name "MYPRECIOUS."
- **Token Symbol:** The token is identified by the symbol "MYP."
- **Token Balances:** It keeps track of user balances using a mapping that associates addresses with token amounts.
- **Mint Function:** The `mint` function allows adding tokens to a user's balance, increasing the total token supply.
- **Burn Function:** The `burn` function subtracts tokens from a user's balance and decreases the total token supply when the user has enough tokens.


## Description

This Solidity program is a simple smart contract for educational purposes, focusing on two core functions: minting (adding) and burning (subtracting) assets. It serves as a practical example for learning about Ethereum smart contract development.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract MyToken {
    string public coinName = "MYPRECIOUS";
    string public coinSymbol = "MYP";
    uint public totalCoinSupply = 0;
    
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function mint(address user, uint amount) public {
        totalCoinSupply += amount;
        balances[user] += amount;
    }

    function burn(address user, uint amount) public {
        if (balances[user] >= amount) {
            totalCoinSupply -= amount;
            balances[user] -= amount;
        }
    }
}


```

### To compile the code, follow these steps:


1.) Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab located in the left-hand sidebar.

2.) Ensure that the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or a compatible version).

3.) Click on the "Compile Solidity.sol" button to compile the code.

### Once the code is successfully compiled, proceed to deploy the contract as follows:

1.)Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

2.)From the dropdown menu, select the "Solidity" contract.

3.)Click the "Deploy" button to initiate the deployment process.

### After deploying the contract, you can interact with its two primary functions:

1.)Use "burn" to subtract Ethereum (ETH) assets.

2.)Use "mint" to add assets, keeping interactions at a high-level for simplicity.
